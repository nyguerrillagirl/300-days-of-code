- PROJECT: Creating Car Driving Video Game [CRVG]
  - Informal Approach (online)
    - Worked on online tutorial #2 on an Engine [24]
      - There was a major flaw in the code presented. There were two class methods that were
        created to return a bool but neither one returned any value. I kept getting the following 
        error message:
        Process returned -1073741795 (0xC000001D)
        Copilot informed me that the code indicates an "illegal instruction". It suggested all sorts of issues
        none of which applied since just adding 
        "return true;" 
        fixed the issue.
        This was a very frustrating issue. I think Visual Studio would have indicated the problem ...hmm let me see if
        there were compilation warnings...
        Yes. I missed it: 
        C:\300-days-of-code\src\cb_cpp_projects\SoftEngine\src\Core\Engine.cpp:11:1: warning: no return statement in function returning non-void [-Wreturn-type]
        I will pay attention to warnings now.

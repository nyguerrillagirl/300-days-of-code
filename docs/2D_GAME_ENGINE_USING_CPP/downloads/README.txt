These files were downloaded in order to obtain the assets described/used as part of the video tutorial series.

From https://www.patreon.com/c/madsycode/posts I was able to download the following files:
- For video #2 SoftEngine - gameLoop.rar
- For video #3 SoftEngine - mainWindow.rar
- For video #4 SoftEngine-TextureMgr.rar
- For video #5 SoftEngine-vector-transform.rar
- For video #6 SoftEngine-gameobjects.rar

You will either need to follow my notes, utilize a github repo that obtained the assets and code
and has made available the assets and code or join the patreon of madsycode for the rest of the 
series.

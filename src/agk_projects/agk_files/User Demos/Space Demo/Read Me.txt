Space Demo - Created by Matty H

Demo shows how a selective bloom effect can be created. Since the bloom is 
selective we can really crank it up without effecting the rest of the scene, this
allows us to create a great sun effect.

Android version also uses accelerometer so the user can look around the scene, the user
should lay their device flat to look directly at the sun.

Enjoy!!!

## This folder holds C++ projects created with Code::Blocks

### Project helloworld
A test project

### Project SoftEngine
A simple 3D engine written in C++ using SDL2. 
It is a basic implementation of a 2D engine that can render simple 2D objects 
and perform basic transformations.
The project follows the video tutorials at the playlist:

I created step by step notes on each video, which can be found here:

I added additional information on all the SDL2 functions and data types used from the SDL2 documentation:

# 300-days-of-code
Today (4/15/2025)I decided to start a new repo to start the next 100 days of code.

This holds material on courses I am taking (will now include notes) + projects
I will try to create PDF files for all the Microsoft Word document I create. The
Word documents have the advantage of being able to display animated gifs! 


The goal is to stay more focused on the things I am working on. 

# GOAL #1: Complete all current Coursera courses
- Meta Frontend Developer
- Google Cybersecurity

# GOAL #2: Learning Data Science
- Datacamp courses

# Goal #3: Project - Creating a Car Racing Video Game
- Informal Approach/Learning
    - Following youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-K0viiuJ2RctP5nlJlqmHGeh66-GOZR_
        - Code in src/cb_cpp_projects/SoftEngine as I follow the series
    - [Pikuma Courses](https://pikuma.com/)
        - 2D Game Engine with C++ and Lua
        - 2D Game Physics Engine Programming
    - [AppGameKit](see: https://www.appgamekit.com/)

# Goal #4: Full Stack Development
- Spring

# Goal #5: Book Club
- Tech Reading
- Non-tech Reading

I decided to move some of the documentation I create as part of the 300-days-of-code

made me lose one day of notes.

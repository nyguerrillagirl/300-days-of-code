# 300-days-of-code
This holds material on courses I am taking (will now include notes) + projects

Today (4/15/2025)I decided to start a new repo to start the next 100 days of code.

The goal is to stay more focused on the things I am working on. 

# GOAL #1: Complete all current Coursera courses

# GOAL #2: Learning Data Science
- Datacamp courses

# Goal #3: Project - Creating a Car Racing Video Game
- Informal Approach/Learning
    - Following youtube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-K0viiuJ2RctP5nlJlqmHGeh66-GOZR_
        - Code in src/cb_cpp_projects/SoftEngine as I follow the series
    - [Pikuma Courses](https://pikuma.com/)
        - 2D Game Engine with C++ and Lua
        - 2D Game Physics Engine Programming

- Non-tech Reading

I decided to move some of the documentation I create as part of the 300-days-of-code 
under Github.  I usually have them saved in OneDrive but I got a corrupt file which
made me lose one day.

Under /docs
- 2D_GAME_ENGINE_USING_CPP
    - This documents a youtube video I am following "Tutorial Create 2D Game Engine"

Under /src
- Under cb_cpp_projects (Code::Blocks C++ Projects)
    - SoftEngine
        - This is the code associated with the 2D_GAME_ENGINE_USING_CPP
